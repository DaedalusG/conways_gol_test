This is a randomized initial condition game of life (gol) that runs in browser. It's meant to be used with the live server extension in vs code.

This algorithm runs through every cell on the gol grid in order to generate the next interation of the game. While this works it is an inefficient method when dealing with large grids. Operating on O(n^4) runtime yikes!
